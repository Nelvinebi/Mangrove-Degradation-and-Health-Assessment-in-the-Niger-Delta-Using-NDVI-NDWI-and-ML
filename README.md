Mangrove Degradation and Health Assessment in the Niger Delta
Using NDVI, NDWI, and Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project assesses mangrove ecosystem health in the Niger Delta using synthetic remote sensing indices—NDVI and NDWI—combined with machine learning techniques. It demonstrates how satellite-derived vegetation and water indicators can be used to identify degraded versus healthy mangrove zones for environmental monitoring and decision-making.

🎯 Objectives

Simulate NDVI and NDWI data representing mangrove environments

Classify mangrove health status (healthy vs degraded) using ML

Provide GIS-ready outputs for spatial analysis and visualization

🧪 Data

Type: Synthetic dataset

Features: NDVI, NDWI, pixel coordinates

Label: Mangrove health status

Format: Excel (.xlsx), suitable for ML and GIS workflows

🧠 Methodology
